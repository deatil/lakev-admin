# YAML Reference implementation (test tool)
# https://www.json2yaml.com/

plain:
  This unquoted scalar
  spans many lines.

quoted: "So does this
  quoted scalar with colon space: .\n"

question 1:
  This is a text, with a 
  colon and space: but no quotes. It's a key / value, and not a text

question 2:
  Same with hypen and space - xxx
  But hypen space are only detected at beginning of line

quoted 2: Same as above
  but no quotes

Are keys allowed
  to span multiple lines: answer is no

# VS Code editor is not recognising it. Is that valid YAML or not?
"Are keys allowed
  to span multiple lines": answer is no

# Hmm. Also not detected by VS Code. But I'm reasonably sure this is valid YAML.
"simple": what this simple one 

quoted 3: # comment
  this is a multi-
  line text
